### Design Details

- User can choose a tab for the league of which they'd like to see games for.
- Boxscore dynamically populates game periods (or innings, for MLB).
- The far right of the Boxscore dynamically populates total game stats per team.
- Team names are on top.
- Stadium name, city, state, and game status are on the bottom.

### App Structure & Flow

- `Index` page loads, calls the `Home` component.
- Data comes from the `/api/games` endpoint, which fetches data from the provided JSON URLs.
- Latest game data is pulled upon loading the app, inside the `Home` component, and continues to be pulled every minute. Useful if this webpage were kept open on a television at a bar or a restaurant.
- `Home` component calls `Tabs` and `BoxScore` components.
- `BoxScore` component calls `QuickStatHeaders` and `QuickStats` components.
- Interfaces are defined in `/models/interfaces`.
